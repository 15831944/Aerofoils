BUGS

Edit Wing dialog - Root and Tip edit buttons have inconsistent positions. FIXED

Plot - moves are being drawn as lines  FIXED.

Fix or remove new core in plot FIXED

Edit Wing Flags dialog - plot section button misaligned. FIXED

Not obvious that the select item is highlighted

Doesn't make sense to have tranform for a G-Code snippet

Sending commands when disconnected hangs Cutter.

Possible to get into an odd mode where the serial data read from the cutter is being buffered after a comms failure.  i.e. send a command but receive the status from the previous command.


Improvements

Separate cut of top and bottom from either direction

Create Plot from Cut and vice versa.

Graphical output when Edit Wing dialog is open (add to dialog)  Also, remove root and tip dialogs and add their contents into Edit Wing.

Plan view of cutter when width and block position defined

Rotate tapered wing to make TE parallel to edge of block

Have all the G-Code related stuff in Cutter menu rather than some in File menu.

Adaptive step size in cutter for G-code output- start large and reduce step in U until error in x/y < 0.5*resolution.

Add DXF import into plot

Extend scope of DXF import

Splash screen on Cutter

Scripting

Validate G-Code snippets on entry.

Automatic lightening holes

Proper G-Code editor
